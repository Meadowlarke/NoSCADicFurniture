# NoSCADicFurniture

This is a collection of OpenSCAD scripts for CNC cut DIY projects. Inspired by the old classic *Nomadic Furniture* I have replicated one of their designs, but have also included some of my own designs and some items which I have copied. 

Designs are all tracked here as OpenSCAD scripts which will need to be complied exported to your machine or to a CAM editor to create the gcode.
