# Crop top

This is a little crop top is based on a turtle neck crop top by American Apparel. I wanted to make the same bodice shape out of bias cut muslin, hence the slit in the back panel. If you are doing this in knit, after the original, I would make identical front and back panels. I also made the turtleneck collar which is optional. 

I made this so that I could cut these shirts out on a laser cutter. I guess you could also print these panels out and do it by hand.
