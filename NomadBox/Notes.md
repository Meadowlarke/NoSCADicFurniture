### 1st try

It seems to me that feed speed should be somewhere between 100 and 160 ipm. So I set it to 120. Worked pretty well. 

Set start height to 5.3 mm (tickness of the wood) and cut depth to 0. It didn't go all the way through in some places. Increasing to .5 mm.  

The bottom edge was pretty rough, didn't cut all the way through, really.

I ran into a problem where VCarve cut OUTSIDE of the tab slots, so the box was super sloppy. 

Also, the plywood was not perfectly cut in half and was a little bit short. one of the pieces went off the edge. I'm going to scoot the parts as far to 0 X in the future just as insurance against this kind of thing, which will definately happen again. 

## 2nd try

Start height 5.3mm, cut depth of -0.2 mm. Very high quality in some places, kinda fuzzy in others only left a little bit of a shadow on the spoil board. I might try -0.1mm to cause less wear to spoil board. Would a last pass be useful here?

Set feed to 160 ipm at 16000 rpm. I like it. Nice big chips

Double checked that VCarve was going to cut the tab slots correctly, from the inside. This time the box fits together. It is a little wobby, I liked the older ones with no allowance that fit together super snug. I am going to reduce the fudge allowance from 1mm to .5 mm.  

I realized that you can't actually fit all of the parts for two boxes  on a half-sheet of plywood. This is annoying beacuse I cut all my sheets in half. I'll just make two files though, one for boxes 1 and 2, and another for boxes 3 and 4, where one has and exta A piece and the other an extra B piece.  

Anyway, the 1 box that I did make is nice.
